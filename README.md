# Phase 1 Week 1 Code Challenge

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for basic programming challenges focused on grading, salary calculation, and speed detection.

## Contents

- **grade.js**  
  Prompts the user for marks (0-100) and displays the corresponding grade (A-E) using an alert.

- **net salary.js**  
  Calculates net salary based on user input for basic salary and benefits. Computes deductions for NSSF, NHIF, and tax, then displays the results in the console.

- **speed.js**  
  Prompts the user for a car's speed and logs "Ok" if the speed is 70 or below. If above, it calculates demerit points and logs either the points or "License suspended" if points exceed 12.

- **Index.html**  
  HTML file to run the JavaScript files in the browser. Open the console to view outputs.

## Usage

1. Open `Index.html` in your browser.
2. Follow the prompts for each challenge.
3. View results in the browser's console or as alerts.
